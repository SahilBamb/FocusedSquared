If you want to achieve greatness stop asking for permission
Things work out best for those who make the best of how things work out
You are not willing to risk the usual you will have to settle for the ordinary
Trust things will work because you are willing to accept the risk, not because it’s safe or certain
All our dreams will come true if we have the courage to pursue them
Just when the caterpillar thought the world was ending, he turned into a butterfly
Opportunities don’t happen, you create them
One more step to greatness
You can do anything, but not everyone
Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day-in and day-out
