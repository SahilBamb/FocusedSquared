Even in dark times, we cannot relinquish the things that make us human.
I survived because the fire inside burned brighter than the fire around me
You can’t break a man the way you break a dog or a horse. The harder you beat a man, the taller he stands
Hope is what makes us strong. It is why we are here. It is what we fight with when all else is lost
Don’t be sorry, be better

Success is a public affair. Failure is a private funeral
Failure is not the falling down but the staying down.
