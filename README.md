# FocusedSquared
This Python pixel-art productivity game helps students focus on studying through a pomodoro timer and rewards. 

# Description 
Students begin with a 2x2 tile grid that they can plant seeds onto that will grow into plants that can be harvested for money. That money can then be spent on other seeds or items. The grid can be expanded tile by tile until it is a 10x10 grid. All art assets were created by me in Adobe Photoshop or Aesprite.
