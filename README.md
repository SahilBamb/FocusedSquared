This Python pixel-art productivity game helps students focus on studying through a pomodoro timer and rewards. 

# Description 
Almost every game system has been developed from scratch, from the tile system to the graphics system, to the inventory system, to the animation system, to the item system, to the inventory system, to the planting and growth system and the shop system. One of the most unexpectedly difficult aspects of the game to program was the isometric expandable grid. The grid images needed to be loaded in a specific order so that they would look like an isometrically aligned grid. Additionally the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of each tile could not directly correspond to its actual position in the grid, it needed to account for the tile size of all tiles as well as the adjustments of a isometric image. 

These are some of the challenge that presented themselves while developing this game without a game engine. 

# How to Play
Students begin with a 2x2 tile grid that they can plant seeds onto that will grow into plants that can be harvested for money. That money can then be spent on other seeds or items. The grid can be expanded tile by tile until it is a 10x10 grid. All art assets were created by me in Adobe Photoshop or Aesprite.
